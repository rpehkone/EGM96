## EGM96

This function (and hard coded geoid heightmap of 2MB) returns corrected sea level altitude for WGS84.

The EGM96 geoid defines the nominal sea level surface by means of a spherical harmonics series of degree 360. The deviations of the EGM96 geoid from the WGS84 reference ellipsoid range from âˆ’105m to +85m.
